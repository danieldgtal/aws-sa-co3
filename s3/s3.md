# AWS S3 - Advanced README for SAA-C03 Exam Prep

## 📦 Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Amazon S3 is an object storage service offering high availability, durability, and scalability. It’s used for storing any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

---

## ✅ Core Concepts

### 🧱 Buckets and Objects
- Buckets are containers for storing objects.
- Each object consists of **key (filename)**, **value (data)**, and **metadata**.
- Global namespace: bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts.

### 🔐 Access Control
- **IAM Policies**: User or role-based access.
- **Bucket Policies**: JSON-based, resource-wide control.
- **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**: Legacy feature; grants specific users access.
- **S3 Block Public Access**: Prevents accidental public access to data.

### 🔑 Encryption
- **SSE-S3**: AWS-managed keys.
- **SSE-KMS**: Uses AWS KMS for key management and audit logging.
- **SSE-C**: Customer-provided keys.
- **Client-side encryption**: Encrypt before upload.

### ☁️ Storage Classes

| Class                    | Use Case                                     | Durability | Availability |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|
| S3 Standard             | Frequently accessed data                     | 99.999999999% | 99.99%      |
| S3 Intelligent-Tiering  | Auto-moves data between tiers                | 99.999999999% | 99.9–99%    |
| S3 Standard-IA          | Infrequent access                            | 99.999999999% | 99.9%       |
| S3 One Zone-IA          | Infrequent access in a single AZ             | 99.999999999% | 99.5%       |
| S3 Glacier              | Archival; retrieval in minutes/hours         | 99.999999999% | Varies       |
| S3 Glacier Deep Archive | Long-term backup; retrieval in hours         | 99.999999999% | Varies       |

### 🔁 Lifecycle Management
- **Transitions**: Move objects to cheaper storage class (e.g., IA, Glacier).
- **Expiration**: Permanently delete objects after X days.
- Supports **versioned** and **unversioned** buckets.

### 🧾 Versioning
- Preserves, retrieves, and restores every version of every object.
- Required for **MFA Delete**.
- Enables recovery from accidental deletion.

### 🌐 Static Website Hosting
- Bucket must be **public**.
- Use index and error documents.
- Route53 or CloudFront can be used with custom domains.

### 🚦 Event Notifications
- Trigger **SNS**, **SQS**, or **Lambda** on PUT, DELETE, etc.
- Useful for serverless/event-driven architectures.

### 📈 Logging and Monitoring
- **Server access logs**: Logs requests made to the bucket.
- **CloudTrail data events**: Logs API access to S3.
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Request counts, errors, bytes transferred.

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices
- Enable **encryption at rest** (SSE-S3/SSE-KMS).
- Block public access unless explicitly required.
- Use **least privilege IAM policies** and **bucket policies**.
- Enable **CloudTrail**, **AWS Config**, and **Access Analyzer**.
- Enable **versioning + MFA Delete** for sensitive data.

---

## 🧠 Exam Tips (SAA-C03)
- Use **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** when access pattern is unknown.
- Use **pre-signed URLs** for secure temporary access.
- Understand **strong consistency** behavior (as of Dec 2020).
- Choose **S3 Transfer Acceleration** for global uploads.
- Know the difference between **Alias and CNAME** for routing.
- Pair **S3 + CloudFront** for secure, low-latency content delivery.

---

## 📚 Advanced Features
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**: Replicates to another region. Requires versioning.
- **Multi-Region Access Points**: Global access to replicated buckets.
- **Object Lock**: WORM (Write Once Read Many) protection.
- **Requester Pays**: Accessors pay for data transfer.

---

## 🔧 Integration Use Cases
- Use with **Lambda** for image processing.
- Use with **Athena** for querying structured data stored in S3.
- Mount as a file system using **s3fs** or access via **DataSync**.
