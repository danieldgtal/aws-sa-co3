# AWS S3 - Advanced README for SAA-C03 Exam Prep

## 📦 Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Amazon S3 is an object storage service offering high availability, durability, and scalability. It’s used for storing any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

---

## ✅ Core Concepts

### 🧱 Buckets and Objects
- Buckets are containers for storing objects.
- Each object consists of **key (filename)**, **value (data)**, and **metadata**.
- Global namespace: bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts.

### 🔐 Access Control
- **IAM Policies**: User or role-based access.
- **Bucket Policies**: JSON-based, resource-wide control.
- **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**: Legacy feature; grants specific users access.
- **S3 Block Public Access**: Prevents accidental public access to data.

### 🔑 Encryption
- **SSE-S3**: AWS-managed keys.
- **SSE-KMS**: Uses AWS KMS for key management and audit logging.
- **SSE-C**: Customer-provided keys.
- **Client-side encryption**: Encrypt before upload.

### ☁️ Storage Classes

| Class                    | Use Case                                     | Durability | Availability |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|
| S3 Standard             | Frequently accessed data                     | 99.999999999% | 99.99%      |
| S3 Intelligent-Tiering  | Auto-moves data between tiers                | 99.999999999% | 99.9–99%    |
| S3 Standard-IA          | Infrequent access                            | 99.999999999% | 99.9%       |
| S3 One Zone-IA          | Infrequent access in a single AZ             | 99.999999999% | 99.5%       |
| S3 Glacier              | Archival; retrieval in minutes/hours         | 99.999999999% | Varies       |
| S3 Glacier Deep Archive | Long-term backup; retrieval in hours         | 99.999999999% | Varies       |

### 🔁 Lifecycle Management
- **Transitions**: Move objects to cheaper storage class (e.g., IA, Glacier).
- **Expiration**: Permanently delete objects after X days.
- Supports **versioned** and **unversioned** buckets.

### 🧾 Versioning
- Preserves, retrieves, and restores every version of every object.
- Required for **MFA Delete**.
- Enables recovery from accidental deletion.

### 🌐 Static Website Hosting
- Bucket must be **public**.
- Use index and error documents.
- Route53 or CloudFront can be used with custom domains.

### 🚦 Event Notifications
- Trigger **SNS**, **SQS**, or **Lambda** on PUT, DELETE, etc.
- Useful for serverless/event-driven architectures.

### 📈 Logging and Monitoring
- **Server access logs**: Logs requests made to the bucket.
- **CloudTrail data events**: Logs API access to S3.
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Request counts, errors, bytes transferred.

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices
- Enable **encryption at rest** (SSE-S3/SSE-KMS).
- Block public access unless explicitly required.
- Use **least privilege IAM policies** and **bucket policies**.
- Enable **CloudTrail**, **AWS Config**, and **Access Analyzer**.
- Enable **versioning + MFA Delete** for sensitive data.

---

## 🧠 Exam Tips (SAA-C03)
- Use **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** when access pattern is unknown.
- Use **pre-signed URLs** for secure temporary access.
- Understand **strong consistency** behavior (as of Dec 2020).
- Choose **S3 Transfer Acceleration** for global uploads.
- Know the difference between **Alias and CNAME** for routing.
- Pair **S3 + CloudFront** for secure, low-latency content delivery.

---

## 📚 Advanced Features
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**: Replicates to another region. Requires versioning.
- **Multi-Region Access Points**: Global access to replicated buckets.
- **Object Lock**: WORM (Write Once Read Many) protection.
- **Requester Pays**: Accessors pay for data transfer.

---

## 🔧 Integration Use Cases
- Use with **Lambda** for image processing.
- Use with **Athena** for querying structured data stored in S3.
- Mount as a file system using **s3fs** or access via **DataSync**.

# 🧠 AWS S3: Lifecycle, Notifications, Requester Pays, Performance & More (SAA-C03)

This document outlines advanced S3 features you need to understand for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) exam.

---

## 🔁 S3 Lifecycle Rules

### 📌 Purpose:
Automate **transition** and **expiration** of objects to optimize cost.

### 🔧 Features:
- **Transition Actions**: Move data to cheaper storage (IA, Glacier, etc.) after X days.
- **Expiration Actions**: Permanently delete objects after a defined period.
- Works with **versioned and unversioned** buckets.
- Can be scoped by prefix or tag filters.

### 🧠 Exam Tips:
- Lifecycle rules help control storage costs.
- Combine with **Intelligent-Tiering** for unpredictable access patterns.

---

## 💸 Requester Pays Buckets

### 📌 Purpose:
Shift **data transfer and request costs** to the requester.

### 🔧 Use Cases:
- Public datasets (e.g., genomics, weather).
- Cost sharing in multi-org or cross-account access.

### 🧠 Exam Tips:
- **Disabled by default**.
- Requester must use `x-amz-request-payer` header.
- Owner still pays for **storage**.

---

## 🔔 S3 Event Notifications

### 📌 Purpose:
Trigger workflows upon object-level events (e.g., PUT, DELETE).

### 🔧 Supported Targets:
- **Amazon SNS**
- **Amazon SQS**
- **AWS Lambda**

### ✅ Triggers:
- ObjectCreated
- ObjectRemoved
- ObjectRestore
- ReducedRedundancyLostObject

### 🧠 Exam Tips:
- You **cannot use both Lambda notifications and EventBridge** on the same bucket.
- For fan-out, send from S3 → SNS → multiple subscribers.

---

## 🚀 S3 Performance Optimization

### 📌 Strong Read-After-Write Consistency:
- Automatically available for **all operations** in all AWS Regions.

### 🧠 Best Practices:
- Use **multipart upload** for large objects (>100 MB).
- Use **Transfer Acceleration** to speed up global uploads.
- Use **parallelization** (e.g., range GETs) for faster downloads.

---

## 📊 S3 Storage Lens

### 📌 Purpose:
Analyze and optimize storage usage across accounts and organizations.

### 🔧 Key Features:
- Organization-wide storage visibility.
- Pre-configured dashboards in the AWS Console.
- Metrics: Object count, storage class usage, lifecycle status, etc.
- Can export metrics to S3 for custom analysis.

### 🧠 Exam Tips:
- Use **S3 Storage Lens** for cross-account visibility.
- Great for **chargeback**, **compliance**, and **cost optimization** tracking.

---

## 📦 S3 Batch Operations

### 📌 Purpose:
Perform large-scale changes on millions or billions of objects.

### 🔧 Actions Supported:
- Copying objects
- Setting object tags or metadata
- Initiating Lambda functions
- ACL updates
- Restore from Glacier

### ✅ Usage Flow:
1. Create a manifest (CSV or S3 Inventory).
2. Choose an operation.
3. Optionally attach a Lambda.
4. Track progress via AWS Console or CLI.

### 🧠 Exam Tips:
- Great for **reprocessing**, **retagging**, or **migrating** datasets.
- **IAM permissions** must allow access to both source and destination.
