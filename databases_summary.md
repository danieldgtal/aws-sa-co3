# 🧠 Choosing the Right AWS Database Service

AWS offers a range of purpose-built databases. Selecting the right one depends on your **data model**, **use case**, **access patterns**, and **consistency/performance needs**.

---

## 📚 Relational Databases

### 1. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
> ✅ General-purpose relational database.

- Supports: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server
- Use Case: Traditional apps, ERP, CRM, e-commerce, OLTP
- Backup, patching, replication handled by AWS
- Read replicas (except SQL Server), Multi-AZ for HA

**When to use:** If you're lifting-and-shifting or building a standard relational app.

---

### 2. Amazon Aurora
> ⚡ High-performance, cloud-optimized relational database.

- Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Up to 5x faster than standard MySQL
- Auto-scaling storage (up to 128 TB)
- Global databases and cross-region replication

**When to use:** Need relational database with better performance, availability, and lower management overhead than RDS.

---

## 🧾 NoSQL & Key-Value Databases

### 3. Amazon DynamoDB
> 🌩️ Serverless, key-value and document database.

- Millisecond latency, scales to millions of requests/sec
- Built-in backup, TTL, DAX (caching), Streams
- Supports Global Tables (multi-region writes)
- Integrates with Lambda, AppSync (GraphQL)

**When to use:** Real-time apps like gaming, IoT, session stores, shopping carts.

---

### 4. Amazon ElastiCache (Redis / Memcached)
> 🧠 In-memory key-value store for ultra-fast data access.

- Redis: Pub/Sub, persistence, replication, clustering
- Memcached: Simple key-value cache
- Used for caching, session management, real-time analytics

**When to use:** Need **sub-millisecond latency** for caching or ephemeral data storage.

---

## 🧮 Document & Graph Databases

### 5. Amazon DocumentDB
> 📄 Managed document DB compatible with MongoDB.

- Supports semi-structured JSON data
- Indexing, querying, and aggregation on documents
- Designed for scalability and availability

**When to use:** If you're already using MongoDB or need flexible document-based storage.

---

### 6. Amazon Neptune
> 🔗 Fully managed graph database (supports Gremlin, SPARQL, openCypher).

- Handles highly connected data (social networks, knowledge graphs)
- Designed for fast traversal queries
- Integration with SageMaker for Graph ML

**When to use:** When relationships matter more than rows (e.g., fraud detection, recommendations).

---

## ⏱️ Time-Series & Ledger Databases

### 7. Amazon Timestream
> 🕒 Time-series database for IoT and DevOps metrics.

- Built-in memory tier, long-term retention tier
- Optimized for timestamped data + aggregation
- Integrates with Grafana, CloudWatch, QuickSight

**When to use:** Storing time-stamped data like application logs, sensor data, CPU usage, etc.

---

### 8. Amazon QLDB (Quantum Ledger DB)
> 📜 Immutable, cryptographically verifiable transaction log.

- Tracks all changes to application data
- Fully managed ledger database with built-in auditability
- No blockchain complexity

**When to use:** Systems that need audit trails, e.g., supply chain, banking, certification.

---

## 🔑 Columnar / Cassandra-Compatible

### 9. Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)
> 🧱 Managed, serverless Cassandra-compatible DB.

- Works with Cassandra Query Language (CQL)
- Scalable, highly available
- Integrated with IAM and VPC

**When to use:** Migrating Cassandra workloads or need write-heavy, scalable columnar store.

---

## ☁️ Object Storage (Used as Database in Some Use Cases)

### 10. Amazon S3
> 🪣 Object storage used for static files, logs, backups, and sometimes semi-structured data.

- Not a database, but widely used for data lakes
- Integrates with Athena (SQL-on-S3), Redshift Spectrum, and Glue
- Lifecycle management, versioning, replication

**When to use:** Storing unstructured/semi-structured data, big data analytics.
